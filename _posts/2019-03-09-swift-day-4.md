## My 4th Day of Learning Swift.

* During my 4th day of Learning Swift I learned several things about loops
  - loops in swift do not use any parentheses around the head of the loop
  - the classic iterates over every element in a collection
  - the while loop iteraes, while a certain condition is true
  - the while loop possibly runs endlessly
  - 'break' can be used to interrupt a loop
  - an outerloop can be named and broken within an innerloop by its name
  - continue skips the rest of an iteration and lets the lets the programm run the next piece of code


```swift
import UIKit

// for loops

let count = 1..<10

for number in count {
    print("Number is \(number)")
}

let albums = ["Red", "1989", "Reputation"]

for album in albums {
    print("\(album) is on apple music")
}

// if you dont use the constant a for loop gives you, use _

print("players gonna ")

for _ in 1...5 {
    print("play")
}

for number in [2, 3, 5] {
    print("\(number) is a prime number.")
}

// While Loops

var number = 1

while number <= 20 {
    print(number)
    number += 1
}

print("Ready or not, here I come.")

// repeat loops (similar to while loops)

repeat {
    print(number)
    number -= 1
} while number >= 1

print("Now number is very low again.")

// exiting loops

var countDown = 10

while countDown >= 0 {
    print(countDown)
    
    if countDown == 4 {
        print("I am bored. Let's start!")
        break
    }
    
    countDown -= 1
}

// exiting multiple loops

// use break outerLoop

outerLoop: for i in 1...10 {
    for j in 1...10 {
        let product = i * j
        print ("\(i) * \(j) is \(product)")
        
        if product == 50 {
            print("It's a bullseye!")
            break outerLoop
        }
    }
}

// skipping items

// use continue

for i in 1...10 {
    if i % 2 == 1 {
        continue
    }
    
    print(i)
}

// infinite loops

var counter = 1

while true {
    print(" ")
    counter += 1
    
    if counter == 273 {
        break
    }
}
```
