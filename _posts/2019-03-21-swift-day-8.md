## My 8th Day of Learning Swift
* Today I have learned about structs, which make it possible to define your own types in swift
* A struct can have multiple different _properties_. For example a user struct could contain two strings for name and a string for height
* Struct properties mostly are variables and so can be manipulated
* Property observers `willSet` and `didSet` watch property manipulation and execute code if they notice any
* functions inside of structs are called _methods_. They can use the properties
* If methods have to change struct properties, they must be explicitly declared as `mutating func`
* _Arrays_ and _Strings_ are structs as well. There are several methods for them, like `count()`, `sorted()`, `append()`

```swift
import UIKit

// Swift let's you design your own types as so called structs
// Structs can be given their own variables and constants and their own functions, then created and used however you want

struct Sport {
    var name: String
}

var tennis = Sport(name: "Tennis")
print(tennis.name)

// both, tennis and name are variables and so can be changed
// these are called stored properties

tennis.name = "Lawn tennis"

// computed properties
// these are properties that run their own code to figure out their values

struct Sport2 {
    var name: String
    var isOlympicSport: Bool
    
    var olympicStatus: String {
        if isOlympicSport {
            return "\(name) is an Olympic Sport"
        } else {
            return "\(name) is not an Olympic Sport"
        }
    }
}

let chessBoxing = Sport2(name: "Chessboxing", isOlympicSport: false)
print(chessBoxing.olympicStatus)

// Porperty observers
// These are run before or after a property changes

struct Progress {
    var task: String
    var amount: Int {
        didSet {
            print("\(task) is now \(amount)% complete")
        }
    }
}

var progress = Progress(task: "Loading data", amount: 0)
progress.amount = 30
progress.amount = 60
progress.amount = 100

// Functions inside of structs are called methods
// These functions are called methods and can use the properties of the struct as they need to

struct City {
    var population: Int
    
    func collectTaxes() -> Int {
        return population * 1000
    }
}

var london = City(population: 9_000_000)
london.collectTaxes()

// Mutating methods: If you want to change a property inside a function you need to use a method that contains the 'mutating' keyword

struct Person {
    var name: String
    
    mutating func makeAnonymous() {
        name = "Anonymous"
    }
}

var person = Person(name: "Ed")
person.makeAnonymous()

// Properties and methods of Strings
// Strings are structs, so they have their own methods and properties we can use to query and manipulate the string

let string = "Do or do not, there is no try."
print(string.count)
print(string.hasPrefix("Do"))
print(string.uppercased())
print(string.sorted())

// Arrays are structs as well

var toys = ["Woody"]
print(toys.count)
toys.append("Buzz")
toys.firstIndex(of: "Buzz")
print(toys.sorted())
toys.remove(at: 1)

```
