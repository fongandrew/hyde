## My first day of Learning Swift - 6th March 2019

In my first swift lecture I have learned about 
* variable and constant declaration in Swift and value assertion for variables
* declaration of multiline strings in Swift
* string interpolation
* type annotations

```swift
//: Playground - noun: a place where people can play

import UIKit

// variables are defined with 'var'

var str = "Hello, playground"
str = "Goodbye"
var age = 38
var population = 8_000_000

// multiline Strings are created with triple quotation marks

var str1 = """
This goes \
over multiple \
lines.
"""

// Integers hold whole numbers, doubles hold fractional numbers, booleans hold true or false

var pi = 3.141
var awesome = true

// string interpolation - place variable inside of strings

var score = 85
var score_str = "Your score was \(score)."
var test_score_str = "The test results are here. \(score_str)"

// constants are defined with let

let mercedes = "benz"

// type annotations

let album: String = "Lust Lust Lust"
let year: Int = 2011
let good: Bool = true
let price: Double = 1.78
```
